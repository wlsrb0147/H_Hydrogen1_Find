To change render pipeline to URP or BasicRP, please do the following:

1.) Delete all folders except for "Textures"
The folders you should delete, may include, but not be limited to:
- Materials
- Meshes
- Prefabs
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Shaders
- Sounds

2.) Extract your chosen unitypackage patch file
URP Patch
or 
BasicRP Patch

(These Patch files will be located in the root directory of your package)

3.) Open Project Settings (Edit > Project Settings)
Click on the "Player" tab, and set the Color space to "Linear" 

4.) If you ever encounter any issues with shaders not working, please contact me at justin@davis3d.com
Sometimes Amplify Shader Editor requires a recompile of the shaders for newer engine versions in order for them to work correctly.
So when that happens, I will upload shaders to this location until the latest update is approved by the Unity Asset Store Administrators.
